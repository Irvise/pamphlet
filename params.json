{"name":"A Pamphlet against R","tagline":"Computational Intelligence in Guile Scheme","body":"# Welcome to the Pamphlet\r\n[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language\r\nthat has been gaining popularity in the domains such as\r\nmachine learning and artificial intelligence over the\r\nrecent years. It has been praised for its simplicity and\r\nelasticity, and its creators were even assigned [a rockstar\r\nstatus](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10551243).\r\n\r\nIn my pamphlet, I claim that this \"blazing new technology\"\r\nis actually a step backwards in the development of the domains\r\nthat it tries to tackle, and the better means of expression,\r\nor better tools for doing the job, were available at least\r\nsince the 70, and that recently they are only getting better.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet explores and expresses various *computational\r\nintelligence methods* using [Guile](http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/),\r\na very pleasant implementation of the [Scheme](http://www.schemers.org)\r\nprogramming language.\r\n\r\nSo if you like the R programming language, I encourage you to\r\ngrab [the PDF version of the Pamphlet] right now to get a broader\r\nperspective on programming. If you dislike it, then I encourage\r\nyou even more.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure to [get the libraries](http://github.com/panicz/pamphlet)\r\nneeded to run the examples.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
